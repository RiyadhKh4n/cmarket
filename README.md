* ## Development Method

    When developing (WEBSITE) I will take an Agile Approach. Meaning I will take an iterative approach to project management and software development helping me to deliver value faster and speed up development time. I will focus on working software over comprehensive documentation and responding to change over following a plan when creating the project.

    I also intergrated the MoSoCoW method which is a four-step approach to prioritizing which project requirements will provide the best return on investment (ROI). MoSCoW stands for Must- Have, Should-Have, Could-Have and Wont-Have. Using this method, I am able to label and order my User Stories into four categories, allowing me to know which ones to focus on and to ensure I meet my project vision and aims.
   

* ## Structure

    (WEBSITE) will be developed using Django, as a result I will split the program functionality into separate apps. A Django application is a Python package that is specifically inteded for use in a Django project. For my project I will create five apps; Home, Products, Bag, Profiles and Checkout.

    Home:
    - To display the Home page (index.html)
    - Will not have models as it does not require any database information, this is a static page displaying information

    Products: 
    - To handle the viewing of products in the Shop page, as well as the creating, editing and deleting of products by the admin user
    - Will have a Product model (product details) and Category model (product categrory names)
    - Templates:
        - Shop (displays all products, filter/sort options)
        - Product Details (displays individual product)
        - Add Product (add product form, admin user only)
        - Edit Product (edit product form, admin user only)

    Bag: 
    - To handle adding items to the shopping cart, adjusting quanitity in the shopping bag and removing items
    - There is no model in this app, however it will use the Product model from the Products App in its views
    - Templates:
        - Bag (display items in the shopping bag)

    Profiles:
    - To handle the user information - their saved delivery details and their order history
    - Will have a USerProfile model which extends the Django User model using a OneToOne link, to store the extra information (delivery details)
    - This app also uses the Order model from the Checkout App to display the order history
    - Templates:
        - My Profile (display/allows edits of saved delivery details and displays order histroy, registered users only)

    Checkout: 
    - To handle the checkout and payment process
    - Will have an Order model (order delivery and amoutn details) and OrderLineItem model (details of each individual item in the order)
    - This app will also use the Product and UserProfile models from the other apps in the views
    - Will contain the code which contect to the Stripe webhook as well as the JavaScript needed to get the payment process working
    - Templates:
        - Checkout (dleivery + payment form)
        - Order confirmation (success page after checkout, also used to display details og a previous order form the profile page)

# E-Commerce Business Model

The following section documents the planning process for the website, based on the type of e-commerce application it is, what products it is selling, and the customers it will have.

## E-commerce application type

This e-commerce application sells its products to customers who are individuals, therefore the business model is a B2C (Business to Customer). The website will sell products (rather than services) and is based on a single payment model, i.e. the customer pays for the product and that completes the transaction, there are no ongoing fees or subscriptions. The model is a Direct to Consumer one, i.e. there are no third party intermediaries involved.

These factors mean that the following need to be taken account in the design/planning of the website:

- Customers, as individuals rather than businesses, might make impulse buys
- The website will need good quality images of the products, to show the customers what they are buying and to build trust in what they are buying
- The decision making process is shorter and they can make their own choice to buy the product (as opposed to justifying the expenditure to managers, which is the case in the B2B model)
- As a result, the steps the user needs to take to complete a purchase on the website should be as easy as possible and the design should take account of this.
- Since products are being sold, the database will need to store the details of these products
- There should be an ability for the customer to sort and filter products in the shop
- As the payment is a single payment, customers would expect to receive a confirmation once they have completed their purchase

## Features to be included

Based on the above analysis, an initial overview of features that would be needed are listed below. The full list of features implemented are outlined in the [Existing Features](https://github.com/RiyadhKh4n/portfolio-project-5#existing-features) section.

- Since items will be sold direct to customer and are all cryptocurrency related, the website should make it clear that all products are crypto-related (this should follow into the product descriptions)
- The site should contain high-quality images of all products as well as descriptions of the products so users can easily make the decision to buy
- The shop should allow users to sort and filter the products by the relevant categories so customers can find what they are looking for
- The path to making the purchase should be as easy/seamless as possible to allow the customer complete the transaction
- There must be a shopping bag/cart functionality so that users can add items to the cart, view the cart and ither go back to shopping or complete the checkout process
- There needs to be a login and authentication mechanism for users, so they can view their details and order history. Anonymous checkout should also be allowed if users do not have an account created
- There needs to be a chekcout process, and for registered users an option to use their saved delivery details for a quicker checkout
- Customer loyalty is an important factor, so there should also be a newsletter sign up, so that the site owner can keep customers up to date with latest products and deals. There should also be a Facebook Business page which is linked in the footer

## Databases and Data Required

Based on the above analysis, an inital overview of the models that would be needed for the site, and type of data in these tables can be seen below. A full description of the data models can be found in the [Database Schema section](https://github.com/RiyadhKh4n/portfolio-project-5#erd-diagram).

- A Users table, to store information about users, such as name, email address and password so they are able to login
- A UserProfile table can extend the above, to include additional information such as the saved delivery address
- A Products table, used to store information such as product name, description, price, sku, image and the category
- An Orders table, to store the user, their delivery information and the order details
- A linked table to this would be OrderLineItems which would be the individual items in an order and store the product information and quantity of that product

# Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)

SEO is important for all business, so that the website can be found by search engines and rank in their results, so that users will actually find the website when searching for the relevant terms. There are two parts to this: determining the keywords that might be searched for, and using them in the website; and generating the files the search engines will use to crawl the website.

## Keywords

Keyword research was completed in order to determine which keywords to include in the website's content, image file names and alt text, headings, page titles and in the meta description and meta keywords. A mix of short and long tail keywords were identified (from brainstorming and using Google to find related searches), within the key topics for the website like cryptocurrency and clothing. Without having access to paid keyword planner websites, it is somewhat difficult to find alternative words for some of the most popular keywords, however this would be a future feature to be implemented if the business was a real business.

### Implementation of keywords

- The ```meta``` ```description``` and ```keywords``` tags were included in base.html, so that they are present for all pages. These were then tweaked on some pages to be more specific to those pages
    
    - The products page has specific meta description and meta keywords related to the products
    - In the product details page the product name is added to the meta description

- The content aims to be trustworthy, relevant, expert and authoratative. The website includes a Privacy Policy and Terms of Use documents for trustworthiness. The product and market images are high quality (bearing in mind these are sourced using free resources but would be professional images if this were a real business)

### sitemap.xml & robots.txt

The sitemap.xml was created to list all the page urls that can be accessed without logging in, this helps the search engines crawl the site. A robots.txt was created, listing the urls for search engines not to access (the listed urls are to do with account sign in, the bag and checkout process and the adding of products since these are not relevant for search results). The existence of the robots.txt file will help improve SEO ranking as it shows the website acknowledges that the search engines are allowed onto the site, so is an indicator of quality. Both files exist on the deployed site. Note: since this is a project and not a live site for a real business (and hasn't been deployed to a custom domain), the last steps of registering the sitemap with Google and testing the robots.txt have not been done.

# Deployment
 
## GitPod - during development

Gitpod was used as the development environment, with GitHub for version control and hosting the repository. The repository for this project, and the associated workspace, was created from the [Code Institute student tempate](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).

- During development, code was written in the Gitpod workspace and changes to the frontend were previewed by opening the browser via the terminal in Gitpod, using the command ```python3 manage.py runserver``` and then selecting the Open Browser button when the following message appeared: "a service is available on Port 8000".
- Libraries/Frameworks used in the application were installed by typing the relevant install command (as per documentation) in the terminal, e.g. ```pip3 install django```, where Django is the name of the framework being installed
- Files and code were added to the staging area in Gitpod using the command ```git add .``` and commited using ```git commit -m "commit message"```.
- Commited changes were then pushed to GitHub using the ```git push``` command.

## Deployment to Heroku

The following steps show how to deploy the application to [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login), using [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) to host media and static files. Note: these steps explain how you would do this, however some steps will be irrelevant if you are forking the repository as it will already contain settings.py file for example. You can also install the requirements in one go using the requirements.txt file instead of individually as explained below. The below steps are intended as a guide to explain how this project was deployed.

### Inital set up in workspace:

Before deploying to Heroku, the initial set up and creation of the project and app need to be completed in the IDE, in this case Gitpod workspace. Do the following in the command line:

1. Install django ```pip3 install Django==3.2``` Note: using version 3.2 of Django and not the latest version which is version 4. and gunicorn: ```pip3 install django gunicorn```
2. Install gunicorn for running the deployed website ```pip3 install gunicorn```
3. Install supporting libraries - for postgres: ```pip3 install dj_database_url pyscopg2```
4. Install any other required libraries/tools
5. Create the requirements.txt file: ```pip3 freeze --local > requirements```. This creates the requirements.txt file with the above dependencies. Later on in development, any further dependencies that are installed can be added to the file using ```pip3 freeze > requirements.txt```. Heroku will use this file to install the requirements when creating the application on Heroku.
6. Create the django project: ```django-admin startproject projectname .```. The ```.``` means create the project in the current directory
7. Create a ```.gitignore``` file at the top directory level and add ```*.sqlite3``` to it, so that any sensitive data in the development database doesn't get pushed to GitHub, and ```*.pyc``` and ```__pycache__/``` because the complied python code is not needed in version control
8. Create app: ```python3 manage.py startapp appname```.
9. Go to ```settings.py``` (this is located in the project folder) and add the appname to ```INSTALLED_APPS``` list
10. The creation of the app creates initial migrations for the model and these need to be migrated. Back in the commandline: ```python3 manage.py migrate```

Repeat steps 8, 9 and 10 throughout development as you create further apps within the project. When models are created or updated during development, the changes also need to be made and migrated using ```python3 manage.py makemigration``` and ```python3 manage.py migrate```. Remember you will need to do the migrations on the production database as well. To view the local version of the project before deployment to heroku, use ```python3 manage.py runserver```, and open the port 8000 when it pops up.

### Create the app on [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) and attach the database:

1. Sign in to/create account on Heroku, and "create app". If you don't have an account, then set one up: Click the Sign up button in the header, fill out the form and Click Create Free Account when done. You will receive an email, click the link to confirm. Then you will be brought to page called SET YOUR PASSWORD. Enter password, click SET PASSWORD AND LOG IN. Will then show welcome page, click on CLICK HERE TO PROCEED, then click Accept to accept the terms of service. Then click on "Create new app". If you do have an account then Sign In to your account and go to the Dashboard. Click on "New" on the top right of the screen and then "Create new app"

2. Under App name, enter the name of the application. Note: the name must be unique, so you would not be able to name it the same as the already deployed version

3. Then choose the Region and click "Create app"

4. Attach the database: go to the Resources tab, Add-ons and then search for 'Heroku Postgres'. Add and choose e.g. Hobby Dev

5. Back in the workspace, create a new file called ```env.py``` to store the environment variables. The file should be in the top level directory, and it should also be added to the ```.gitignore``` file to ensure it does not get pushed to GitHub as it contains sensitive information

6. In env.py:

    - import os
    - ```os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = '```generate a secret key and paste it here'

7. Back in Heroku, go to Settings tab, Config Vars, click Reveal Config Vars. Add a new one called ```SECRET_KEY``` and paste in the value from the ```env.py``` file

8. In the workspace go to the ```settings.py``` file and do the following (no need if using this project's settings.py file):

    - add ```import``` os underneath where it says ```from pathlib import Path```
    - underneath this, ```import dj_database_url```
    - and then add a conditional statement to import the ```env.py``` when in the development environment.

    ```python
    if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
    import env
    ```

    This means the environment variables in ```env.py``` are used while in the development workspace, but if not in the development environment then it will use the ones set in Heroku.

    - update the value for ```SECRET_KEY``` to get it from ```env.py``` or Heroku: ```SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')```
    - update the ```DATABASES``` section so that it connects to Heroku Postgres database on the deployed site (where there is a DATABASE_URL config var), and to the development sqlite3 in the local environment:

    ```python
        if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
        DATABASES = {
                'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
            }
        else:
            DATABASES = {
                'default': {
                    'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                    'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
                }
            }
    ```

    When you need to connect to the Postgres database from the local development environment (e.g. to run migrations, create a superuser, etc.), you can adjust the above as needed so that you connect to Postgres. You will need to add the DATABASE_URL value to connect, but remember not to commit this to the repo as it should remain secret.

9. Attach to the Postgres database (adjust in settings.py as needed, and use the database_url key but do not commit it) and in the command line, make the migrations to the Heroku Postgres database: ```python3 manage.py migrate```

10. Then import the data using the fixtures files. Repeat the following command, with appropriate file name for each fixture file (categories, products, counties, markets) to import the data to the Postgres database: ```python3 manage.py loaddate filename```. Note the categories file must be imported before products, and counties before markets as they contain the foreign key information.

11. After doing the above, revert the DATABASES settings back as shown in step 8 above, so that production is connected to Postgres and development attached to local sqllite3 database.

### Add allowed hosts and create Procfile:

1. In ```settings.py```, find the ```ALLOWED_HOSTS``` list and add the heroku appname to it: ```ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['yourherokuappname.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']```. This is so that the Heroku hostname is recognised and Django will allow it to run the project

2. Create a file named ```Procfile```, this must be at the top level directory

3. Inside the Procfile add ```web: gunicorn projectname.wsgi```. This is so that Heroku knows how to run the project


### Inital Deployment:

1. Add all the changes above, commit them and push them to GitHub using ```git add```, ```git commit -m "commit msg"``` and ```git push``` commands in command line

2. Go to Heroku and in Config vars, add ```DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC``` with a value of 1, for the initial deployment.

3. In the Deploy Tab, go to Deployment method and click GitHub

    - If have not connected to GitHub previously:
        
        - Underneath, it will show a section called Connect to GitHub, with a button at the bottom called “Connect to GitHub”. Press this button.

        - A pop up will ask you to Authorize Heroku’s access to your GitHub – click to Authorize, then enter your password and Confirm Password

        - The pop up will close and in the Connect to GitHub section it will show your GitHub username and a box to search for the repository to connect to.

    - If have already connected to GitHub you do not need to do the above and it should show your GitHub username and a box to search for the repo name as above

    - Enter the repo-name in the box and press Search

    - Underneath, it will display the repo: ```yourGitHubUsername/your-github-repo-name```, then press "Connect"     

    - Once connected it will show: Connected to ```yourGitHubUsername/your-github-repo-name``` by ```yourGitHubUsername```

4. Underneath the Connect section, there are two options "Automatic deploys" or "Manual deploy"

    - Automatic – future pushes to GitHub will mean Heroku automatically builds a new version of the app with the pushed changes

    - Manual – the app is not automatically updated with future pushes to GitHub but these can be manually made if needed.

    - Click, Deploy Branch. I deployed using Manual. The logs will show the dependencies and requirements being installed. When done, the page will refresh and say “Your app was successfully deployed” with a View button.

#### To do the above setps 3 & 4 through command line instead:

- Use command ```heroku login -i``` and enter you username and password when prompted. You will see confirmation in the terminal that you are logged in.

- Set the remote for the app on heroku using command heroku ```git:remote -a APP-NAME```. You should see confirmation that the remote has been set to the heroku remote for that app.

- Push to heroku to do the deployment, using command ```git push heroku main``` (when you push to the repo on github you will use command ```git push origin main```)

- You will see the build log in the terminal and after it has completed it will confirm the deployment was done, with the version number and the url for the website

*The rest of the process is the same regardless of whether the deployment was done through Heroku dashboard or via the command line:*

5. In Heroku, Click the Open app (or View button if still in the Deploy tab in Heroku) to view the app – it opens in a new window. For the initial deployment the static and media files have not been used but the database information should be there.
